Build Status

The Nuclei Microcontroller Software Interface Standard(NMSIS) is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for micro-controllers that are based on Nuclei processors.

The NMSIS defines generic tool interfaces and enables consistent device support. It provides simple software interfaces to the processor and the peripherals, simplifying software re-use, reducing the learning curve for micro-controller developers, and reducing the time to market for new devices.
